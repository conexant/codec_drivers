Wakeup M3 Remote Proc Driver
=====================

TI AMx3 Family devices use a Cortex M3 co-processor to help with various
low power tasks that cannot be controlled from the MPU. The CM3 requires
a firmware binary to accomplish this and communicates with the MPU through
IPC registers present in the SoCs control module. The wkup_m3 remoteproc
driver handles the loading of the firmware and exposes an API to
communicate with the wkup_m3 through the use of the IPC registers and a
mailbox.

Wkup M3 Device Node:
====================
A wkup_m3 device node is used to represent a wakeup M3 IP instance within
a SoC. The sub-mailboxes are represented as child node of this parent node.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Should be "ti,am3353-wkup-m3" for AM33xx SoCs
- reg:			Contains the wkup_m3 register address ranges for
			umem, dmem, and ipc-regs.
- reg-names:		Names for reg addresses given above
- interrupts:		Contains the interrupt information for the wkup_m3
			interrupt that signals the MPU.
- ti,hwmods:		Name of the hwmod associated with the mailbox
- ti,no-reset-on-init:	Reset is handled after fw has been loaded, not at
			init of hwmod.
- mbox-names:		Name of the mbox channel for the IPC framework
- mbox:			Phandle used by IPC framework to get correct mbox
			channel for communication.

Example:
--------
/* AM33xx */
wkup_m3: wkup_m3@44d00000 {
	compatible = "ti,am3353-wkup-m3";
	reg = <0x44d00000 0x4000
	       0x44d80000 0x2000
	       0x44e11324 0x0024>;
	reg-names = "m3_umem", "m3_dmem", "ipc_regs";
	interrupts = <78>;
	ti,hwmods = "wkup_m3";
	ti,no-reset-on-init;
	mbox-names = "wkup_m3";
	mbox = <&mailbox &mbox_wkupm3>;
};
