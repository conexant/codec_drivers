* Texas Instruments BB2D blitter module

This binding describes the 2D BitBlit (BB2D) graphics accelerator
subsystem based on the GC320 core from Vivante Corporation available
in Texas Instruments SoCs.

Required properties:
  - compatible: value should take the following format:
        "ti,<soc>-bb2d", "vivante,<gpuversion>"
    accepted values:
     (a) "ti,dra7-bb2d", "vivante,gc320" for TI DRA7xx / AM57x

  - reg : base address and length of BB2D IP registers
  - interrupts : BB2D interrupt line number
  - ti,hwmods : name of the hwmod associated with BB2D module
  - clocks : handle to BB2D functional clock
  - clock-names : fclk

Example for DRA7x SoC:
        bb2d: bb2d@59000000 {
            compatible = "ti,dra7-bb2d", "vivante,gc320";
            reg = <0x59000000 0x0700>;
            interrupts = <GIC_SPI 120 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
            ti,hwmods = "bb2d";
            clocks = <&dpll_core_h24x2_ck>;
            clock-names = "fclk";
        };
