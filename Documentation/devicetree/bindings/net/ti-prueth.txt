Texas Instruments PRUSS Ethernet MAC
====================================

Required properties:
- compatible       : Should be one of the following,
                        "ti,am3359-prueth" for AM335x SoCs
                        "ti,am4372-prueth" for AM437x SoCs
                        "ti,am57-prueth" for AM57xx SoCs
                        "ti,k2g-prueth" for 66AK2G SoCs

- pruss            : Must point to a pruss device node
- sram	           : pHandle to OCMC SRAM node
- interrupt-parent : pHandle to the PRUSS INTC node

Must contain children, one for each of the MAC ports.
Required properties for children:
- phy-handle       : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- phy-mode         : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- interrupt-names  : should be "rx" and "tx"
- interrupts       : should contain an array of PRUSS system event
                     numbers used as the interrupt sources for Rx
                     and Tx respectively.

Optional properties for children:
- local-mac-address	: mac address for the port.

Example (am572x-idk board):
===========================
	pruss2_eth {
		compatible = "ti,am57-prueth";
		pruss = <&pruss2>;
		sram = <&ocmcram1>;
		interrupt-parent = <&pruss2_intc>;

		pruss2_emac0: ethernet-mii0 {
			phy-handle = <&pruss2_eth0_phy>;
			phy-mode = "mii";
			interrupts = <20>, <22>;
			interrupt-names = "rx", "tx";
			/* Filled in by bootloader */
			local-mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
		};

		pruss2_emac1: ethernet-mii1 {
			phy-handle = <&pruss2_eth1_phy>;
			phy-mode = "mii";
			interrupts = <21>, <23>;
			interrupt-names = "rx", "tx";
			/* Filled in by bootloader */
			local-mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
		};
	};
