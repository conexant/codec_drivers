TI Wilink (wlcore) SDIO devices

This node provides properties for controlling the wilink wireless device. The
node is expected to be specified as a child node to the SDIO controller that
connects the device to the system.

Required properties:

 - compatible : Should be "ti,wlcore".
 - interrupt-parent : the phandle for the interrupt controller to which the
	device interrupts are connected.
 - interrupts : specifies attributes for the out-of-band interrupt.

Example:

&mmc3 {
	status = "okay";
	vmmc-supply = <&wlan_en_reg>;
	bus-width = <4>;
	cap-power-off-card;
	keep-power-in-suspend;

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	wlcore: wlcore@0 {
		compatible = "ti,wlcore";
		reg = <2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio0>;
		interrupts = <19 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
	};
};
