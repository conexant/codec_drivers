Texas Instruments System Control Interface (TI-SCI) Reset Controller
=====================================================================

Some TI SoCs contain a system controller (like the Power Management Micro
Controller (PMMC) on Keystone K2G SoC) that are responsible for controlling
the state of the various hardware modules present on the SoC. Communication
between the host processor running an OS and the system controller happens
through a protocol called TI System Control Interface (TI-SCI protocol).
For TI SCI details, please refer to the document,
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/keystone/ti,sci.txt

TI-SCI Reset Controller Node
============================
This reset controller node uses the TI SCI protocol to perform the reset
management of various hardware modules present on the SoC.

Required properties:
--------------------
 - compatible	: Should be "ti,sci-reset"
 - ti,sci	: phandle to the TI SCI device to use for managing resets
 - #reset-cells	: Should be 2. Please see the reset consumer node below for
		  usage details.

TI-SCI Reset Consumer Nodes
===========================
Each of the reset consumer nodes should have the following properties,
in addition to their own properties.

Required properties:
--------------------
 - resets	: A phandle and reset specifier pair, one pair for each reset
		  signal that affects the device, or that the device manages.
		  The phandle should point to the TI-SCI reset controller node,
		  and the reset specifier should have 2 cell-values. The first
		  cell should contain the device ID, the values of which are
		  specified in the <dt-bindings/genpd/<soc>.h> include file.
		  The second cell should contain the reset mask value used by
		  system controller, the values of which are specified in the
		  include file <dt-bindings/reset/<soc>.h>, where <soc> is the
		  name of the SoC involved, for example 'k2g'.

Please also refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt for
common reset controller usage by consumers.


Example:
--------
The following example demonstrates both a TI-SCI reset controller node and a
consumer (a DSP device) on the K2G SoC.

#include <dt-bindings/genpd/k2g.h>
#include <dt-bindings/reset/k2g.h>

/ {
	soc {
		k2g_reset: k2g_reset {
			compatible = "ti,sci-reset";
			ti,sci = <&pmmc>;
			#reset-cells = <2>;
		};

		dsp0: dsp0 {
			...
			resets = <&k2g_reset K2G_DEV_CGEM0 K2G_DEV_CGEM0_DSP0_RESET>;
			...
		};
	};
};
