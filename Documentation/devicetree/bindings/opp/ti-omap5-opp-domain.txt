Texas Instruments OMAP compatible OPP domain description

This binding uses the "<supply-name>-opp-domain" binding documented at [1]
and describes the OPP domain devices typically used on Texas Instruments
OMAP compatible SoC family of processors.

OMAP5, DRA7, and AM57 family of SoCs have Class0 AVS eFuse registers which
contain data that can be used to adjust voltages programmed for some of their
supplies for more efficient operation. These are provided to the OPP domain
driver so that when a voltage transition is requested by the OPP core, we can
make an adjustment to the voltage before setting the supply.

Also, some supplies may have an associated vbb-supply which is an Adaptive Body
Bias regulator which much be transitioned in a specific sequence with regards
to the vdd-supply and clk when making an OPP transition, and this driver handles
that sequencing.

Required Properties:
- compatible: Should be one of:
	"ti,omap-oppdm" - basic OPP domain controlling VDD and VBB
	"ti,omap5-oppdm" - OMAP5+ optimized voltages in efuse(class0)VDD
			    along with VBB
	"ti,omap5-core-oppdm" - OMAP5+ optimized voltages in efuse(class0) VDD
			    but no VBB.
- vdd-supply: phandle to regulator controlling VDD supply
- vbb-supply: phandle to regulator controlling Body Bias supply (optional if
  "ti,omap5-core-oppdm")
  (Usually Adaptive Body Bias regulator)
- #oppdm-cells: shall be <0>
- reg: Address and length of the efuse register set for the device (mandatory
	only for "ti,omap5-oppdm")
- ti,efuse-settings: An array of u32 tuple items providing information about
	optimized efuse configuration. Each item consists of the following:
	volt: voltage in uV - reference voltage (OPP voltage)
	efuse_offseet: efuse offset from reg where the optimized voltage is stored.
- ti,absolute-max-voltage-uv: absolute maximum voltage for the OPP domain.

Example:

/* Basic OMAP OPP Domain with no Class0 support */
oppdm_mpu: oppdm@1 {
	compatible = "ti,omap-oppdm";
	#oppdm-cells = <0>;

	vdd-supply = <&vcc>;
	vbb-supply = <&abb_mpu>;
};

/* OMAP OPP Domain with Class0 registers */
oppdm_mpu: oppdm@4a003b20 {
	compatible = "ti,omap5-oppdm";
	#oppdm-cells = <0>;
	vdd-supply = <&vcc>;
	vbb-supply = <&abb_mpu>;
	reg = <0x4a003b20 0x8>;
	ti,efuse-settings = <
	/* uV   offset */
	1060000 0x0
	1160000 0x4
	1210000 0x8
	>;
	ti,absolute-max-voltage-uv = <1500000>;
};

oppdm_core: oppdm@4a003d20 {
	compatible = "ti,omap5-core-oppdm";
	#oppdm-cells = <0>;
	vdd-supply = <&smps4>;
	reg = <0x4a003b20 0x4>;
	ti,efuse-settings = <
	/* uV   offset */
	1060000 0x0
	>;
};
