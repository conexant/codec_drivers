	   Enable this configuration option to support configurable PCI
	   endpoint. This should be enabled if the platform has a PCI
	   controller that can operate in endpoint mode.

	   Enabling this option will build the endpoint library, which
	   includes endpoint controller library and endpoint function
	   library. This will also enable the configfs entry required to
	   configure the endpoint function and used to bind the
	   function with a endpoint controller.

	   If in doubt, say "N" to disable Endpoint support.
