config REMOTEPROC

config OMAP_REMOTEPROC

	depends on HAS_DMA
	depends on ARCH_OMAP4 || SOC_OMAP5 || SOC_DRA7XX

	select RPMSG
	help
	  Say y here to support OMAP's remote processors (dual M3
	  and DSP on OMAP4) via the remote processor framework.

	  Currently only supported on OMAP4.

	  Usually you want to say y here, in order to enable multimedia
	  use-cases to run on your platform (multimedia codecs are
	  offloaded to remote DSP processors using this framework).

	  It's safe to say n here if you're not interested in multimedia
	  offloading or just want a bare minimum kernel.

config OMAP_REMOTEPROC_WATCHDOG
	bool "OMAP remoteproc watchdog timer"
	depends on OMAP_REMOTEPROC
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to enable watchdog timer for remote processors.

	  This option controls the watchdog functionality for the remote
	  processors in OMAP. Dedicated OMAP DMTimers are used by the remote
	  processors and triggers the timer interrupt upon a watchdog
	  detection.

config STE_MODEM_RPROC
	tristate "STE-Modem remoteproc support"
	depends on HAS_DMA
	select REMOTEPROC
	default n
	help
	  Say y or m here to support STE-Modem shared memory driver.
	  This can be either built-in or a loadable module.
	  If unsure say N.

config WKUP_M3_RPROC
	bool "AMx3xx wkup-m3 remoteproc support"
	depends on SOC_AM33XX || SOC_AM43XX
	select REMOTEPROC
	select MAILBOX
	select OMAP2PLUS_MBOX
	help
	  Say y here to support AMx3xx wkup-m3.

	  Required for Suspend-to-ram and CPUIdle on AM33xx and AM43xx.
	  Allows for loading of firmware and communication with CM3 PM
	  coprocessor that is present on AMx3xx family of SoCs

	  If unsure say N.

config DA8XX_REMOTEPROC
	tristate "DA8xx/OMAP-L13x remoteproc support"
	depends on ARCH_DAVINCI_DA8XX
	select CMA if MMU
	select REMOTEPROC
	select RPMSG
	help
	  Say y here to support DA8xx/OMAP-L13x remote processors via the
	  remote processor framework.

	  You want to say y here in order to enable AMP
	  use-cases to run on your platform (multimedia codecs are
	  offloaded to remote DSP processors using this framework).

	  This module controls the name of the firmware file that gets
	  loaded on the DSP.  This file must reside in the /lib/firmware
	  directory.  It can be specified via the module parameter
	  da8xx_fw_name=<filename>, and if not specified will default to
	  "rproc-dsp-fw".

	  It's safe to say n here if you're not interested in multimedia
	  offloading.

config PRUSS_REMOTEPROC
	tristate "TI PRUSS remoteproc support"
	depends on HAS_DMA && (SOC_AM33XX || SOC_AM43XX || SOC_DRA7XX)
	select REMOTEPROC
	select MAILBOX
	select OMAP2PLUS_MBOX
	select RPMSG
	default n
	help
	  Support for TI PRU-ICSS remote processors via the remote processor
	  framework.

	  Currently supported on AM33xx SoCs.

	  Say Y or M here to support the Programmable Realtime Unit (PRU)
	  processors on various TI SoCs. It's safe to say N here if you're
	  not interested in the PRU or if you are unsure.
	  If unsure say N.
